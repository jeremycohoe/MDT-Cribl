# Topology and Tools Setup

In this section, we will go over setting up your environment. I am doing everything self contained in Cisco Modeling Labs, but the tools can be deployed using any
host that supports docker. I've included the topology files that can be imported directly into CML if it is available to you. If you would like more information
on the topology itself, or using ansible too configure the environment, you can head over to the main [MDD repo](https://github.com/model-driven-devops/mdd/tree/main).
